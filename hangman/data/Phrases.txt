Hello there
What's up
Howdy
A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Call it a day
Cut somebody some slack
Cutting corners
Easy does it
Get out of hand
Get something out of your system
Get your act together
Give someone the benefit of the doubt
Go back to the drawing board
Hang in there
Hit the sack
It's not rocket science
Let someone off the hook
Make a long story short
Miss the boat
No pain, no gain
On the ball
